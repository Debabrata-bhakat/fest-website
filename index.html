                            LiGHT is an expansion project of GYWS which was formed with the idea to reciprocate the
                            model and
                            learnings of
                            GYWS and to provide a social platform to socially motivated youth of India. It was formed in
                            2017 by
                            the

                            Head- Mr. Krushi Bandi , Governing Body Member- Mr. Suyash Yadav of GYWS under the guidance
                            of our
                            founder Mr.

                            It most certainly does. A small amount goes a long way. In fact, individuals’ contributions
                            form
                            almost
                            90 to
                            95% of our income. Taken together, it is these seemingly small contributions that
                            collectively add
                            up to
                            a
                            large amount needed to effect change. There are people all over who are concerned about the
                            situation
                            and who
                            want to do something to change it. However, their own commitments and pressures do not allow
                            them to
                            go
                            out
                            and directly work with situation. LiGHT provides them the opportunity to help in whatever
                            way they
                            can.
                            They
                            can contribute their money, materials, time, or skills. When everybody comes together and
                            pitches
                            in, no
                            task
                            is impossible. This COLLECTIVE ACTION has an impact and brings about change. Every
                            individual’s
                            contribution
                            is important. This is the fundamental principle on which LiGHT functions.

                            The answer can be divided into two parts:
                            <ul>
                                <li>

                                <li> We make plans at the HQ with the involvement of centres and distribute it to the
                                    Centre
                                    Coordinators.

                                <li> Then later the Centre Coordinators further distributes the plan and divides the
                                    work among
                                    the
                                    Core
                                    Team Members and the Volunteers.</li>
                            </ol>

                            Now comes the distribution of plans among the centre nodes, Each of the teams at HQ node is
                            assigned
                            a
                            certain
                            number of centres and then the member of that team manages the centre. Distribution of
                            knowledge is
                            either
                            through various groups formed or through calls or others means of communication. And often
                            we have
                            skype
                            meetings with the centres which help us keep in contact with them and also regular contact
                            is the
                            key to
                            management.

                            centres
                            faced.
                            <br>
                            Here is the hierarchy:<br>

                            <br>
                            Hierarchy helps us to stream down the content easily and feedbacks are accessible easily,
                            also the
                            workflow is
